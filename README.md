# Bamazon

Bamazon is an Amazon like CLI application utilizing MySQL and Inquirer npm.

This app has three interfaces. The Customer, the Manager and the Supervisor view.

With the Customer view you are able to search items by ID and purchase items. If inventory is too low the app notfies the customer that there is insufficient quantity.
