Bamazon is an Amazon like CLI application utilizing MySQL and Inquirer npm.

This app has three interfaces. The Customer, the Manager and the Supervisor view.

With the Customer view you are able to search items by ID and purchase items. If inventory is too low the app notfies the customer that there is insufficient quantity.


Manager view gives the ability to view products for sale, view low inventory, add to inventory and add new products to the database.


Supervisor view (work in progress) gives the ability to view product sales by department and view total profit by looking at over head cost, product sales and total profit.
